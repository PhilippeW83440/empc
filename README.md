Embedded Model Predictive Control (MPC)

We study methods for accelerating Model Predictive Control (MPC) solutions to make them suitable for real-time robotics applications. 
Our project features a summary of existing methods, an efficient implementation of Accelerated Dual Gradient Project algorithm (DGPA), an improvement over an existing DGPA algorithm, and a benchmark with off-the-shell interior point solvers on a constrained and ill-conditioned tracking MPC problem.
